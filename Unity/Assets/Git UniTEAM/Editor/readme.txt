Thanks for grabbing Git UniTEAM!

***********************************************************
** IMPORTANT! **

You must move the "Plugins" folder to the root of your "Assets" folder
in order for the extension to work. Because of the way packages are
added to the Asset Store, there is no way for me to do this for you
without adding the "AssetStore Tools" folder.
***********************************************************

You can access the console from the "Window > Git UniTEAM Console" menu item.

Please be sure that your project is already under Git version control -- at this time, 
Git UniTEAM does not support *Initting* of repositories, but can now Clone remote repos.

It may be important to point out, for future reference, not to version the Git UniTEAM folder; 
your remote Clone requests will likely fail (if made from inside Unity), 
since the git2.dll file will be in use during the cloning process, and therefore unable to be 
overwritten.

Have fun!
